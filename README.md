## Hi there 👋

I'm **Milan**, a Singapore-based student interested in the intersection of **data, climate, and economics**.

---

### 👨‍💻 What I’m doing now

- Serving **National Service** in Singapore.
- Building **SG ClimateHub**, a youth one-stop climate-action platform that:
  - tracks carbon footprints with a Singapore youth-specific emphasis,
  - runs camp-wide eco-challenges for NSFs,
  - provides personalised recommendations on carbon-reduction.
  - gamifies carbon tracking for youth,
  - provides youth with access to exclusive sustainability events across Singapore

---

### 🛠 Tech & tools

- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python, Java, HTML/CSS, SQL  
- **Web:** React, Node.js / Express, basic front-end frameworks, REST APIs  
- **Data & modeling:** statistics, simple optimization and systems modelling, working with APIs/CSV data  
- **Other:** Git/GitHub, MongoDB, basic deployment (Render/Netlify), LaTeX for math-heavy work

I care about writing clear, maintainable code and documenting what I build so others can use it.

---

### 🌍 Interests

- **Climate & tech:** using data and software to make sustainability visible and actionable  
- **Applied math:** modelling real systems (energy, environment, finance)  
- **Quant & economics:** how incentives and risk shape climate and energy decisions  
- **Communication:** turning technical ideas into visuals and stories that non-experts can understand

Long term, I’d like to work on **data-driven climate and sustainability projects**, ideally at the point where tech, policy, and economics meet.

---

### 🚧 Projects / repos

- **ClimateHub-Web** – core web app for SG ClimateHub, a youth climate-action platform  
- **JavaScript-HTML-CSS-practice** – front-end practice projects  
- **css-exercises (The Odin Project fork)** – layout and styling exercises

More repos will appear here as I add features, refactor older code, and spin off new ideas.

### 🤝 Contact

If you’re working on something related to **climate, data, or applied math** and think my interests or skills could be useful, feel free to open an issue or reach out.
